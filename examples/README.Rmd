Here, we consider analyzing a barrier through time.

First, we run MAPS on PSC segments 2-6cM to look at older population structure

```
../src/runeems2 --params params-test-2_6.ini
```

Secondly, we run MAPS on PSC segments > 6cM to look at more recent population structure

```
 ../src/runeems2 --params params-test-6_Inf.ini
```
 
Finally, we plot the results. See `plot-maps.example.R`.
